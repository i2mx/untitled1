That one thing I keep making, I've done spinning [cubes](https://i2mx.github.io/spin/index.html) and [shapes](https://i2mx.github.io/spin/index2.html) with javascript and on [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iij6baqy7p), Finally I've done it in a real programming language.

I would like to add some more shapes and perhaps some deeper graphics stuff.
