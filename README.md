That one thing I keep making, I've done spinning cubes with javascript and on desmos, Finally I've done it in a real programming language.

The faces flicker sometimes, which is odd and I'm not sure how to fix it, it seems to occus when a face is flipping from being viewable from one side to being viewable from another side.
